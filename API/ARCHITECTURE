Terminology:
- queuer: server exposed to clients; pushes to workers
- client: browsers of users visiting the website
- worker: servers which have GPUs and run deep dream
- autoscaler: manages number of workers

Client overview:
Client visits website, gets a FB profile photo URL.
Client hits queuer with FB profile photo URL.
Queuer responds to client with a token.
Client can generate S3 image URLs using that token.
These S3 images indicate the status of the photo.
Client grabs S3(1)...S3(10), and displays these to user.
S3(10) is the last image, and once displayed client is done.

Queuer overview:
Queuer gets hit with an image URL.
Queuer checks if URL is actually FB profile photo.
If not, returns error.
Queuer checks if URL has been requested before.
If so, return that token.
Queuer responds to client with a randomly generated token.
Queuer puts this token and image URL into a managed queue.

Worker overview:
Worker connects to the queuer's managed queue.
Worker places a blocking get on the queue.
Worker gets token and image URL from queue.
Worker carries out deep dream on the image URL.
For each partial dream, worker pushes image to S3.
When dream is completed, worker places get on queue.

Autoscaler overview:
Monitors the size of the managed queue
If the managed queue gets too big, it creates more workers
If the rate of requests is low, it spins down workers
